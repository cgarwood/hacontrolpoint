A modern front-end for HomeAssistant. Designed to have a beautiful, customizable interface for wall mounted dashboards (and eventually mobile phone use).

**Not intended for public use _yet_. This is currently a very basic prototype with most values hard-coded to my specific installation**

Installation is simple, just copy the files to any webserver, rename `js/config.js.example` to `js/config.js` and update the values with your HomeAssistant URL. Make sure HomeAssistant is accepting connections from your IP in its whitelist.
It can run on the same system as your HomeAssistant install, or on a remote host, as long as the remote host can access your HomeAssistant installation.
